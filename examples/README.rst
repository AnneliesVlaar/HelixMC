========

Here is a list of examples in the ``examples/`` folder.

:force_ext:
    This is just the example above.

:link_cst:
    This is for link-contrained simulation, similar to the
    torsioal-trap single-molecule experiment [R2]_.

:z-dna:
    Simulation of Z-DNA using `helixmc-run`.

:fuller_check:
    Check the if the Fuller's approximation is correct in certain criteria.

:data_fitting:
    How to use `helixmc.fitfxn` to fit simulation or experiment
    data to simple analytical models.

:helixplot:
    More examples for plotting the helices.

:Lp_Olson:
    How to perform alternative evaluation of bending persistence
    length using the method suggested by Olson et al. [R1]_.

:bp_database:
    Examples on curating bp-step parameters from PDB.
